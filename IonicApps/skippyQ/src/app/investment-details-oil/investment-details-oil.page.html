              (Bloomberg) – BP Plc increased its dividend and expanded share buybacks after posting record profits of $27.65 billion for 2022.

              Most read by Bloomberg

              The cash-gusher is delivering significant returns to investors — a 10% increase in dividends and an additional $2.75 billion in buybacks — while highlighting a contradiction at the heart of Europe’s oil industry. As major producers increasingly speak of the need to cut emissions and switch to cleaner energy, their polluting fossil fuel business has become increasingly lucrative as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

              BP promised to accelerate investments in both low-carbon energy and fossil fuels. However, the company has slowed its plan to phase out oil and gas and will be less aggressive in curbing its carbon emissions.

              By 2030, fossil fuel production will be about 25% lower than in 2019, excluding the contribution of Russia’s Rosneft PJSC. That’s a major overhaul of its 2020 goal of cutting production by 40% by the end of the decade.

              Shares of the company were up 3.2% to 493.5 pence as of 8:01 am in London.

              “We are increasing our investment in our transition while also increasing our investment in today’s energy system,” Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in a statement Tuesday. “That’s what governments and customers demand of companies like us.”

              BP said it will split additional investment evenly between low-carbon energy and oil and gas, spending up to $8 billion more on each through 2030. Annual capital expenditures may be slightly higher than previously projected, at between $14 billion and $18 billion annually for the remainder of the decade.

              The Company will target petroleum resources that can be developed quickly, offer a quick payback and better overall returns. Last month, BP’s Energy Outlook report predicted that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would accelerate the world’s transition away from fossil fuels as countries seek to increase energy security by generating more renewable energy at home.

              BP committed to driving higher returns from both clean energy and fossil fuels. By increasing capex and raising oil and gas price assumptions, the company said it will grow earnings per share before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 12% a year through 2025.

              BP’s adjusted net income was $4.81 billion in the fourth quarter, down from records set earlier in the year and missing the median analyst estimate of $5.11 billion.

              The earnings boom has been healthy for BP’s balance sheet, something that worried investors in the years following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. Net debt declined for the 11th straight quarter, down $9.2 billion from 2022.

          <h2>Apple should buy ESPN from Disney for $50 billion, says analyst who calls a deal a ‘no brainer’</h2>

          Sports jocks and computer nerds spent a lifetime at odds with each other. If Wedbush managing director Dan Ives gets his wish they might finally have to get along.  Apple buying ESPN from Disney to accelerate its entry into the global sports media landscape would be a “no brainer,” Ives wrote in an analyst note yesterday. An acquisition, which he estimates would be in the $50 billion range, would make the Apple TV+ streaming service more attractive to subscribers by adding more live sports, the “golden goose” of content. “Cupertino plays chess while others play checkers,” Ives told Fortune in an email.  The deal, he said, “would make a ton of strategic sense” for Apple because it would “gain valuable sports content, major TV rights across each of the major professional and college sports packages, and change the cross-sell opportunities and attractiveness of Apple TV, while putting Apple on the sports map globally.”  ESPN declined to comment for this story. Apple did not return a request for comment.  The speculation about an acquisition comes after Disney CEO Bob Iger floated the idea of selling a stake in ESPN, once the company’s crown jewel. The network is grappling with consumers abandoning their cable subscriptions, which puts its business in danger of a slow decline.  Iger has said he is open to “strategic partners” that could help the company with either distribution or content, he told CNBC in July. Disney is “open minded” about the type of deal it would strike with a third party, or the value the partner might bring—content, distribution, or even just cash. The one imperative for any partner, however, was that they accelerate ESPN’s inevitable transition to streaming. “Taking our flagship ESPN channel direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if, but when,” Iger said on the earnings call earlier this month.  Some of the partners Disney had in mind were the very sports leagues that are broadcast on ESPN. Disney reportedly offered equity stakes in ESPN to NBA, NFL, and MLB, presumably as part of negotiations for their contract renewals.  In buying ESPN, Apple would give its Apple TV+ streaming service a lift. It has a limited amount of content compared to rivals like Netflix and Max and is trailing in market share.  A deal would give Apple access to 74 million cable subscribers and an ESPN+ streaming service that has another 24 million paying customers, according to Disney’s 2022 annual report. Despite a decline in Disney’s ad revenue from cable overall, ESPN’s revenue was up a modest 4% in its latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, and up 2% from the prior quarter, Disney chief financial officer Kevin Lansberry said on the company’s latest earrings call.  So far, Apple has dabbled in sports content, acquiring the broadcast rights for leagues like the MLB and the MLS. With the MLS, Apple landed the league’s global distribution rights rather than national or regional ones that are the standard for live event broadcast rights. Apple also narrowly missed out on a college sports deal with the Pac-12 before a conference realignment earlier this month scuttled its plans at the last minute.  Meanwhile, Disney is already making some changes at ESPN. Earlier this month, it entered into a 10-year, $1.5 billion licensing agreement with the casino and sportsbook operator PENN Entertainment that will allow PENN to use the ESPN brand on all its sports betting assets.  In March, Disney's companywide layoffs of 7,000 hit ESPN as part of a plan to trim $5.5 billion in costs. That was followed earlier this summer by ESPN cutting a raft of high profile on-air talent.  In his note, Ives cites challenges to Apple buying ESPN, including Apple’s long-time reluctance to make major acquisitions. The last time it made a major acquisition was in 2014 when it purchased music headphone maker Beats for $3 billion. At the time, in addition to its headphones, Beats had an upstart music streaming service that was eventually folded into Apple Music.  There’s also the question mark raised by a hawkish Federal Trade Commission, chaired by Lina Khan, who’s made her aversion to tech mergers the foundation of her career. Ives, though, characterizes Khan and the FTC as “bark worse than bite,” implying that regulators are surmountable hurdles rather than outright impediments to a future deal.  Finally, Ives’ prediction of an Apple acquisition runs up against the reality of Iger being thus far unequivocal about Disney’s commitment to sports, making a full sale unlikely. “Sports stands tall in a sea of tremendous choice, and is in many respects an advertiser's dream and consumer's dream,” Iger said in the CNBC interview in July. “We have a unique position and we feel that we should stay in it.”  And in August, Iger reiterated that most of the terms of a possible deal were flexible, except for one: Disney “retain control of ESPN.”

          <h2>As the new Eris Covid variant spreads across the world, here’s what we know so far</h2>

          The World Health Organization is monitoring a new strain of Covid-19 called EG.5, or “Eris,” that accounts for a growing share of cases in countries including China and the United States.

          The WHO has designated it a “variant of interest,” meaning it will be monitored for mutations that could make it more severe.

          Based on current evidence, the organization says it presents a low public health risk at a global level, in line with other variants currently in circulation. In May, the WHO more broadly said Covid-19 was now “an established and ongoing health issue which no longer constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.”

          Symptoms and spread
          Symptoms for Eris are reported to be the same as past variants, including a fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, runny nose, and change in taste and smell.

          “While EG.5 has shown increased prevalence, growth advantage, and immune escape properties, there have been no reported changes in disease severity to date,” the WHO said in a risk evaluation published Wednesday.

          It added that these properties may lead the variant to become dominant in some countries, or indeed globally.

          The variant’s official name is EG.5, while “Eris” is a random nickname given online that subsequently popularized the EG.5.1 subvariant.

          Based on sequencing information submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) as of Aug. 7, the largest portion of EG.5 cases were identified in China, followed by the U.S., South Korea, Japan and Canada.

          It was also identified in Australia, Singapore, the U.K., France, Portugal and Spain.

          According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, EG.5 is now the dominant strain in the U.S., accounting for 17.3% of cases as of the week ended Aug. 5.

          Vaccine reformulations
          It comes as Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax prepare to release new Covid vaccines this fall targeted at XBB variants, which descended from Omicron.

          Novavax says its vaccine “induces functional immune responses to XBB subvariants including XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3.” EG.5 is a descendent strain of a variant which shares a spike amino acid profile with XBB.1.5.

          “EG.5 is part of the XBB lineage and is more closely related to the XBB variants than it is to previous vaccine strains,” Justin Lessler, professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health, said via email.

          “For this reason, the expectation is that the reformulated vaccines that will be available this fall will offer better protection to EG.5 than previous vaccines.”

          New vaccines are expected to be available in the U.S. from late September, according to CDC Director Mandy Cohen, as responsibility for vaccine distribution shifts to the private sector.

And so, as delegates descended on Glasgow for the COP26 summit last November, the UK government announced that the country would become “the world’s first net zero-aligned financial centre”. Listed companies and big asset managers would be required to publish a plan for achieving net zero carbon emissions — or explain why they could not.  The UK’s status as a global financial hub meant that the announcement was of more than local interest — and the deadline is now less than a year away. By June 2023, UK-listed companies will have to publish net zero transition plans, as will regulated investors who manage more than £50bn in assets, or own more than £25bn. Smaller asset managers with at least £5bn under management have until June 2024 to follow suit.  What is less certain is precisely what the government will expect plans to comprise, and how it will sanction companies whose plans fall short.  “There’s competition between financial centres to be leaders on this issue,” says Alyssa Gilbert, head of policy at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute for Climate Change. “You can’t just be a leader by having some companies that are green unicorns. You need to raise the bar for everyone. Because of competition, other countries will follow.”  The detailed requirements for transition plans are the remit of the recently formed Transition Plan Taskforce, which includes policymakers, members of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) — the UK’s financial services regulator — and representatives from the finance industry. The TPT will build on the current international standards set out by the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and publish its findings by the end of this year.  These will include how to treat Scope 3 carbon emissions, which cover everything from the start of a company’s supply chain to the final use of its products and its employees’ commuting. That range makes them harder to measure and manage than Scope 1 emissions, which are simply those directly from a company’s own operations, and Scope 2, which arise from the energy it purchases.  “Scope 3 is notoriously difficult,” says Michael Marks, head of responsible investment integration at Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM). “I expect emphasis on Scope 3, but with understanding that it’s very difficult to measure.”  Companies that get on well with their suppliers will fare better, predicts Gilbert. “If you’re talking to your supply chain and have a good relationship, that makes it easier to talk to them about climate change.”  Small and mid-cap companies have furthest to go in catching up on Scope 3, according to Neville White at investment manager EdenTree. “Lots of Scope 3 will be assumptions and modelling rather than hard data,” he says. “At the moment, assumptions could be widely out.” He sees western European countries, including France and the UK, as leading on the issue and likely to set global standards.  Near-term goals are another area to watch. “If 2050 is the only bit of your transition plan, you don’t have a transition plan,” argues Gilbert at Imperial.  Marks agrees: “Where we are today is ‘do you have a target?’ Where we’re going next is ‘do you have a long-term target, medium-term target and a short-term target?’’’  It is the latter that will keep the current cohort of senior managers on their toes, according to White. “There’s no point setting a 2040 target because they won’t be there,” he says.
