      The quality of your portfolio is determined on the basis of the number of
      breached quality criteria, The number of issues within a quality criterion
      or a group of quality criteria is irrelevant. The stars for the
      determination of the portfolio quality are assigned as follows: Analysis
      by asset classes and risk analysis (if available): If the asset allocation
      as well as the portfolio risk lie within the target bandwidths, the
      portfolio quality will be evaluated with 3.5 stars. If one of the two
      criteria is breached, the quality will be evaluated with 1.75 stars. For
      portfolios where no portfolio risk can be determined, 3.5 stars are
      assigned for the determination of the asset allocation. Equities and bonds
      with a sell recommendation as well as equities, bonds and investment funds
      that are not monitored: If the portfolios contains no equities and bonds
      with a sell recommendation and no equities, bonds and investment funds
      that are not monitored, the portfolio quality will be evaluated with a
      further star. Bulk risks, issuer concentration and bonds with a low
      rating: if the portfolio has no bulk risks or issuer concentration and no
      bonds with a low rating are held, the portfolio quality will be evaluated
      with another half star. Hence, the quality of a portfolio can be evaluated
      with a maximum of five stars
